8.3 The Customer is strongly recommended to use all the Support Services available to the Customer, especially during the Software implementation. Not using the Support Services by the Customer may result into inappropriate implementation of the Software, in which case the results obtained from the use of the Software by the Customer may not be optimal.

The Third-Party Software is governed by the licensing terms of the relevant third parties. A list of Third-Party Software is included in the Software Specification or on the Provider’s Community portal available at https://community.kentico.com/documentation/third-party-software-licenses. The Provider may amend this list at any time. The Customer will indemnify the Provider for any loss or damage, including attorney’s fees, arising from any claims against the Provider due to actions of the Customer which allegedly violate the license terms of the Third-Party Software. The Provider declares that, to his knowledge, the Software does not violate any such third-party rights.
14. LIABILITY
14.1 The Customer acknowledges being sufficiently acquainted with the Software and the Software Specification prior to the execution of this Agreement and fully aware of Software’s functionalities. The Customer is solely responsible for determining whether the Software is fit for Customer’s intended use of the Software. The Customer acknowledges, that the Software is not suitable for use in operating environments susceptible to large-scale or serious damage and that defects in the Software may appear during the use of the Software.
14.2 The Customer shall use its best efforts to prevent any damage to Customer or its Content, systems, documents, etc., caused due to defects in the Software (e.g., thorough and comprehensive testing before the Software is released into common use within the Customer’s business or a business of other third persons, including testing of interoperability of the Software with other computer programs or other components). The Customer shall be solely responsible for procuring and maintaining its network connections and telecommunications links, and all problems, conditions, delays, delivery failures and all other loss or damage arising from or relating to the Customer's network connections or telecommunications links or caused by the Internet.
14.3 The Customer hereby declares that it has been advised by the Provider in a clear and understandable manner of the necessary technical and software equipment and network connection to access and use the Software prior to entering into the Agreement. 
14.4 The Provider bears no liability for the functionality of the Customer’s data network, public data networks, hardware and software running on it, and the backing up of the data. The Customer shall ensure that its network and systems comply with the relevant specifications provided by the Provider from time to time. The Provider bears no liability for the state of other programs used by the Customer or for any potential interference by third parties with other programs used by the Customer.
14.5 The Provider shall provide the Customer with updates to the Software which are necessary for its operation in accordance with this Agreement. If a defect in the Software occurs during the term of the Agreement, i.e. the Software does not operate in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall provide the Provider with reasonable assistance necessary to verify whether the defect in the Software was caused by inadequate technical or software equipment of the Customer or its network connection to access the Software. The Customer acknowledges that if the Customer rejects to provide the Provider with required reasonable assistance, the burden of proof regarding the occurrence of the defect in the Software passes to the Customer. 
14.6 Except as expressly and specifically provided in this Agreement:
14.6.1 the Customer assumes sole responsibility for results obtained from the use of the Software by the Customer, and for conclusions drawn from such use. The Provider shall have no liability for any damage caused by errors or omissions in any information, instructions, or scripts provided to the Provider by the Customer in connection with the Software, or any actions taken by the Provider at the Customer's direction;
14.6.2 all warranties, representations, conditions and all other terms of any kind whatsoever implied by statute or common law are, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, excluded from this Agreement.
14.7 The Software is provided to the Customer on an “as is” basis.
14.8 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVIDER’S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING THE LOSS OF PROFITS, THAT MAY ARISE FOR THE CUSTOMER DUE TO A BREACH OF THE PROVIDER’S OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, OR DUE TO DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF US $10. THE PROVIDER SHALL IN NO CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES EXCEEDING THIS LIMIT. THE LIMITATION ABOVE DOES NOT EXTEND TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE PROVIDER TO A NATURAL PERSON ON HIS/HER NATURAL RIGHTS OR CAUSED INTENTIONALLY OR THROUGH GROSS NEGLIGENCE.
14.9 This Agreement is concluded solely between the Provider and the Customer and does not give rise to any obligations, debts or liability of any other company from the Kentico Group.
15. INDEMNIFICATION
15.1 The Provider shall defend the Customer or, at its option, settle any claim or action brought against the Customer alleging that the possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party (a "Claim") and shall be responsible for any reasonable losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred by or awarded against the Customer as a result of or in connection with any such Claim. 
15.2 The Customer shall promptly notify the Provider if any third party makes a Claim, or notifies an intention to make a Claim against the Customer and shall provide the Provider with reasonable assistance that the Provider may request in connection with the defence of such a Claim (e.g. access to its premises and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records). The defence of such Claim shall be conducted by the Provider with counsel selected by the Provider, provided that the Customer shall have the right to participate in such defence through separate counsel of its own choosing retained at Customer’s expense. The Customer is not entitled to make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Provider.
15.3 If any Claim is made, or in the Provider's reasonable opinion is likely to be made, against the Customer, the Provider may at its sole discretion, (i) promptly procure a license for the Customer, at no cost to the Customer, to allow the Customer to continue using the Software in accordance with terms hereof, or (ii) modify the Software without diminishing its functional capabilities to make it non-infringing. If neither of the foregoing is feasible or otherwise commercially reasonable, the Provider is entitled to withdraw from this Agreement. In that case, the Customer is entitled to refund in the amount calculated in accordance with the section 7.5, first sentence, of this Agreement. 
15.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider shall have no obligation to the Customer with respect to any Claim (i) if the Software is being used in violation of the terms of this Agreement (unless such use is authorized by, or at the direction of, the Provider), (ii) if the Software has been modified by the Customer or any third party (unless such modification is authorized by, or at the direction of, the Provider), or (iii) if such Claim is based upon the combination, operation, or use of the Software with any other Software, product, device, or equipment that are not Third-Party Software, or use of which is not recommended by the Provider in writing for normal operation of the Software, if Customer’s liability for such infringement claim would have been avoided in the absence of such modification, combination, use, or operation. Further, the Provider shall have no obligation to the Customer with respect to any Claim to the extent that the Claim arises directly or indirectly through the possession or use of any Third-Party Software or through the breach of any Third-Party Software terms by the Customer.

Further, when possible, a court shall give effect to the intention of the invalid provision to the fullest extent possible within the law.
18. FULL AGREEMENT
18.1 This Agreement represents full and complete agreement of the Parties and replaces all prior agreements or understandings. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties explicitly agree that for the purposes of provision and use of the Software under this Agreement, no terms published on the Provider’s website are binding, unless expressly referred to in this Agreement.
18.2 For the avoidance of any doubt, in the case where the Parties have entered or enter into a separate written agreement on provision of the Software, such agreement prevails. 
19. NO PARTNERSHIP OR AGENCY
19.1 Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall operate to create a partnership between the Parties, or authorize either Party to act as an agent for the other, and neither Party shall have the authority to act in the name of or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including, but not limited to, the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability, and the exercise of any right or power).
20. ASSIGNMENT
20.1 The Customer may not transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement as a whole or any of the Customer’s rights and obligations arising from this Agreement in any manner without the prior consent of the Provider. The Customer agrees that the Provider is entitled to transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement as a whole or any of the Provider’s rights and obligations arising from this Agreement to a third party without any further consent of the Customer being required.

Publication of the Change in the Client Portal shall be considered sufficient notice of such Change. If the Customer does not agree with the Change, the Customer is entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice served to the Provider within 15 days of the publication of the Change in the Client Portal or from the notification of the Change to the Customer in another way. In that case, this Agreement terminates at the time agreed upon by the Parties or, at the latest, 30 days after the Provider was served with the termination notice.

Continued use of the Software after the 15-day period to serve the notice constitutes the Customer’s acceptance of such Change.
